# MultiUnit
 A simple unit converter written in Visual Basic

 This app has a pretty self-explanatory GUI.

# System Requirements
- Windows 7 or later

# Installing

1. Download the installer or build it (see next section)
2. Run the installer, and select whether you want to install it to your system's Program Files or just for your user.

# Building
1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
2. Open up the solution within src\MultiUnit. From the menu bar, hit Build > Build MultiUnit.
3. Windows 7 or later: Now, install Inno Setup if you haven't. Then, compile the installer from the installer folder.

# Cleaning
1. Use the Build > Clean MultiUnit in VS 2022 first
2. Because the installer outputs in a separate folder, clean up the installer using the clean.bat located in the installer folder.
