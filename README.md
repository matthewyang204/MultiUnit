# MultiUnit
 A simple unit converter written in Visual Basic

 This app has a pretty self-explanatory GUI.

# System Requirements
- Windows XP or later
- Windows 7 or later to use the installer

# Installing
1. Download the installer or build it (see next section)
2. Run the installer as admin. While the main installer installs, if the .NET 3.5 installer pops up, walk through it.

# Building
1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 if you haven't. I have an [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/msdn-library-disk-2) page with a valid license key if you don't have a copy.
2. Open up the solution within src\MultiUnit. From the menu bar, hit Build > Build MultiUnit.
3. Now, install Inno Setup if you haven't.
4. Download the offline .NET 3.5 installer from [this page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net35-sp1) and put it in the installer folder.
5. Build the installer with Inno Setup.
