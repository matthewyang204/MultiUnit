# MultiUnit
 A simple unit converter written in Visual Basic

 This app has a pretty self-explanatory GUI.

# System Requirements
- Windows XP or later
- Windows 7 or later to use the installer

# Installing

**Windows 7 or later**
1. Download the installer or build it (see next section)
2. Run the installer as admin. While the main installer installs, if the .NET 3.5 installer pops up, walk through it.

**Windows XP or later**
1. Download the .zip file.
2. Copy the executable to your Program Files folder and link it to your Start Menu manually.

# Building
1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 if you haven't. I have an [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/msdn-library-disk-2) page with a valid license key if you don't have a copy.
2. Open up the solution within src\MultiUnit. From the menu bar, hit Build > Build MultiUnit.
3. Windows 7 or later: Now, install Inno Setup if you haven't. Download the offline installer from [this page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net35-sp1)
3. Windows XP and Windows Vista: Copy the MultiUnit executable in src\MultiUnit\bin\x86\Release to the program files and link it to your start menu manually.
